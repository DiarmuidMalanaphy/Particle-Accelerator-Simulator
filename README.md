# Particle Accelerator Simulation

This project is a 3D simulation of a particle accelerator that allows users to explore the interaction of electrons and positrons colliding at relativistic speeds.

- Discuss how the simulation provides simulations of velocities like that of the LHC, the early CERN synchotron al


The simulation provides an **Educational** mode that describes the kinetic energy of the input particles and the resultant particles at different speeds. This is designed to be useful in a setting where you're attempting to
convey the exponential growth of kinetic energy of particles at close to relativistic speeds.


The simulation also provides an **Experimental** mode that provides for visually appealing particle interactions and behaviors. This is more for casual use and lets the user explore moving around in a 3 dimensional environment
in a fun way.
